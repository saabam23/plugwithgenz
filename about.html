  <h1>ABOUT PLUG</h1>
    <p class="abt-plug">
Plug was founded in 2021 as an idea to spread awareness on social injustice and reduce the mental health stigma. However, after reflecting on my virtual schooling experience, I was determined to find a way to create a support system for teens all over the country who struggled in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>
    </p>
  
<p class="abt-plug">During the pandemic, it was so easy to turn to my phone and social media since I was closed off from nature and the world. I realized that looking at a screen for a long period of time made me forget the little things that mattered the most: life and a sense of shelter.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p class="abt-plug">As a result, after learning the fundamentals of website development in the Girls Who Code Self Paced Program, I finally thought of the idea of coding a website that spreads awareness on mental health and provides resources that teaches teens life skills to improve their well-being. Additionally, I want to hold virtual and in-person events where people can participate in interactive activities to give them a start to discover their outlets and pave the way for them to seek professional help, if needed.</p>
